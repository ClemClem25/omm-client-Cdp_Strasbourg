## Requirements

OpenSesame 3.3.X


## Quick start

- Open `osexp\omm-entry-point.osexp` in OpenSesame and start it.
- Enter a participant number to start a trial.
- Only dummy mode is currently functional.
- The jobs for dummy mode are defined in `openmonkeymind\data\dummy-jobs.yaml`. The `exp` key refers to files in the `osexp` folder.
- By default, only participants 1 and 2 are defined.


## Implementing an experiment for OMM

The experiment `osexp\omm-template.osexp` contains the basic structure of an OMM experiment. Most of the action happens in *trial_sequence*. This can be an arbitrary trial sequence, just like you're used to in regular OpenSesame experiments.

Before *trial_sequence*, *OMMRequestCurrentJob* sets the experimental variables. In that sense, it is similar to what the *block_loop* would do in a regular OpenSesame experiment. When the experiment is launched by the OMM entry-point experiment, jobs are retrieved from the OMM server. When the experiment is launched directly (for testing), jobs are retrieved from the table of *test_loop*.

After *trial_sequence*, *OMMSendCurrentJobResults* sends the job data (i.e. experimental variables) to the OMM server, when the experiment is launched by the OMM entry-point experiment. When the experiment is launched directly (for testing), this item does nothing.

Typically (but not necessarily) an OMM experiment consists of a single trial. A participant will often do multiple trials in a row, but this happens by repeatedly announcing the participant and launching the experiment. In other words, repetition is handled at the level of the entry-point experiment.
